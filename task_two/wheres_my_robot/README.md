# Where's my Robot?

Type `npm run start` to start a dev [server](http://localhost:3000/) at port 3000.

## Comments

- The project uses the create-react-app template and tailwind.css for styling. (run `npm run watch:tailwind` to generate styles on-demand)
- This is my first time using React so things are a bit messy (literally started with the Tic-Tac-Toe example). I have a few comments on how I would organize things differently if I'd be more experienced with React... Any recommendations for good online courses on React & Redux would be great 🙌🏼
